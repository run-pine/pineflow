# Pineflow Core

This is the primary Python package for the Pineflow. It provides essential classes and abstractions that serve as the backbone for applications built with LLMs, particularly Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These foundational components include interfaces for LLMs, vector databases, embeddings, storage systems, callable functions, and more.
